## 🎯 Project Objective
The main objective of this project is to use SQL to analyze retail sales data and answer key business-related questions. The project aims to evaluate overall sales performance, identify high-performing branches and product categories, and understand customer purchasing patterns using structured query analysis.

This project also serves as hands-on practice for applying SQL concepts in a business analytics context.

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project is the **Walmart Sales Dataset**, which contains transactional sales data from multiple branches. The dataset includes information such as branch, city, product line, unit price, quantity sold, total sales, customer type, payment method, and purchase date.

The data was imported from a CSV file into a relational database table for analysis using SQL.

---

## 🗄️ Database Setup
A database was created to store the Walmart sales data, and the dataset was imported into a table. Appropriate data types were assigned to each column to ensure accurate calculations and aggregations during analysis.

This setup enabled efficient querying and analysis of the sales data.

---

## 🔍 Data Exploration
Initial exploration of the dataset was carried out using SQL queries to understand the structure and contents of the data. This included reviewing records, identifying unique values, checking data consistency, and verifying column-level details.

Basic SQL queries were used to gain familiarity with the dataset before proceeding with deeper analysis.

---

## 🧮 SQL Analysis
A series of SQL queries were written to analyze the dataset and answer business questions related to sales and customer behavior. The analysis focused on:
- Sales and revenue performance across branches and cities  
- Revenue contribution by different product lines  
- Customer type distribution and payment method preferences  
- Sales trends across time periods  

These queries demonstrate how SQL can be used to group, filter, and aggregate data to derive insights.

---

## 🛠️ SQL Concepts Used
This project applies essential SQL concepts commonly required for data analyst roles, including:
- Data retrieval using SELECT and WHERE clauses  
- Aggregation using SUM, COUNT, and AVG  
- Grouping data with GROUP BY and filtering using HAVING  
- Sorting results using ORDER BY  
- Using aliases for improved readability  
- Basic date-based analysis  

---

## 📈 Key Insights
The analysis revealed differences in sales performance across branches and cities, highlighting top-performing locations and product categories. Certain product lines were found to contribute significantly to total revenue, while customer payment preferences showed noticeable patterns.

These insights demonstrate how SQL-based analysis can support data-driven business decisions in the retail domain.
